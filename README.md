# 🏙️ AkiroCity

**AkiroCity** is a simple, open-source, turn-based city-building game that runs in the terminal, written in Python.

The goal of the project is **learning by building**:
- game loops
- state management
- systems design
- and open-source workflows

No graphics. No engines. Just logic, choices, and consequences.

## 🎮 Gameplay (v0.1)

- You are the mayor of a small city
- Each turn represents **one year**
- You decide what to build and how to manage resources
- The city grows… or collapses

Core mechanics:
- Population
- Money
- Basic buildings
- End-of-year updates

This is an **early prototype**, intentionally kept small and messy to encourage iteration.

## 🧱 Project Philosophy

- Start simple
- One file first
- Working code > perfect code
- Structure comes later
- Fun is mandatory

AkiroCity will evolve over time as systems are added and the codebase is refactored.
